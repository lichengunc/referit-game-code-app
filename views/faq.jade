      div.answer
       p ReferIt Game is an academic research project created by the Computer Vision Group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill related to natural language processing. We're collecting data on how people construct phrases to refer to objects so that with enough participation we can create algorithms to train computers to do the same. Applications of this are endless and include video and image search and even English-speaking robots. Please share the game on Facebook and like our page <a href='https://www.facebook.com/referitgame'>here</a> to help us reach our goal! And feel free to contact us at <u><a href="mailto:referitgame@gmail.com">referitgame@gmail.com</a></u> with any questions.

       p <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus' style='font-size:20px'></span> How does the game work?
      div.answer
        p You and another player will both be shown the same picture. If you see an item bounded in red, then your goal is to describe the object as best as possible (ex: "Red car in front of the lamppost"). If you are the other player, then your goal is to select the object that the first player describes. You both earn points and swap roles if the second player selects the correct object. The faster you play, the more points you win.

      div.answer
        p Points are awarded when the second player successfully identifies the object in the image described by the first player. Speed is also factored into point allocation.
